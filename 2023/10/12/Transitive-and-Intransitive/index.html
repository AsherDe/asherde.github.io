<p>Transitive and Intransitive: You perceive your whole view passively and focus on a pinpoint actively</p>
<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>I believe that many non-English speakers or people who don’t speak Germanic languages (I’ll explain my discovery through sorting at the end) have been plagued by the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs for a long time in terms of the use of prepositions. We see there are two kinds of marks ahead of the dictionary entries presented as “with object” and “no object” respectively, which correspond to them separately. But how can we sort them based on their properties?<br>In this essay, I will explore the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs in English and Japanese (it’s also Chinese indeed because of the complete use of Chinese characters here). Transitive verbs are verbs that can take a direct object, while intransitive verbs are verbs that cannot. This distinction has implications for the use of prepositions, the role of the subject, and the expression of agency and initiative. I will compare and contrast how these languages handle this distinction and what it reveals about their grammatical and semantic features.</p>
<h1 id="The-connection-between-one’s-initiative-and-the-spectrum-of-the-action-itself"><a href="#The-connection-between-one’s-initiative-and-the-spectrum-of-the-action-itself" class="headerlink" title="The connection between one’s initiative and the spectrum of the action itself"></a>The connection between one’s initiative and the spectrum of the action itself</h1><h2 id="The-cases-in-Japanese"><a href="#The-cases-in-Japanese" class="headerlink" title="The cases in Japanese"></a>The cases in Japanese</h2><p>I will examine them first in Japanese, which has a clear and consistent way of marking transitive and intransitive verbs. In Japanese, transitive verbs are called 他動詞 (tadoushi), which means “other-moving verb” or “other-propulsive verb”, while intransitive verbs are called 自動詞 (jidoushi), which means “self-moving verb” or “self-propulsive verb”. These terms indicate whether the verb expresses an action that affects another entity or not. For example, ドアが開いた (doa ga aita) means “The door opened”, where the door is both the subject and the agent of the action, while ドアを開けた (doa o aketa) means “I opened the door”, where the door is the object and I am the agent of the action. The difference is marked by the use of different verb forms (開いた vs 開けた) and different particles (が vs を).<br>It’s clear and easy to reason that the role of the subject is decisive. And if the object that’s acted upon is absent in form, something that’s acted upon is also the thing that acts.<br>Let’s go back to the meanings and definitions of transitive and intransitive.<br>The meaning of transitive: “be able to go across”<br>The definition of transitive: “able to take a direct object (expressed or implied)”<br>Vice versa for the intransitive.<br>And I wondered about the connection between them and their intertwined inner logic.</p>
<h2 id="Back-to-each-part-of-English"><a href="#Back-to-each-part-of-English" class="headerlink" title="Back to each part of English"></a>Back to each part of English</h2><p>But Japanese is not English, they are not even relatives in any degree. Then I took apart each word in some easy sentences.<br>“I saw him.”  “I looked at him.”<br>Then I discovered that I needed a preposition to indicate the state of the action when I used the intransitive, but why didn’t I need one for a transitive verb? Then I looked up the definitions of these two words from a dictionary and here are their most basic definitions.<br>See (with object): “perceive with the eyes; discern visually”<br>Look (no object): “direct one’s gaze toward someone or something or in a specified direction” and “have the appearance or give the impression of being”<br>I read these sentences totally and each word separately to connect them to my cognition. It’s easy to tell the difference between them. “I saw him” means I “perceived him with my eyes”, which is passive reception. “I looked at him” means I “directed my gaze” to him, which is active participation.<br>The last question was why the preposition is necessary only for an intransitive verb. Then I raised my head, perceived everything in my view, and gazed at some things. And I finally understood through incorporating the initiative of actions in Japanese and the vision of humans in English. When I cast my eyes there’s only a beam emitted and I need to use a preposition to pinpoint my object, so this kind of word is “intransitive”, it’s not able to go across the object so we need a preposition to specify. But why doesn’t the transitive verb need one? Because you can perceive everything within your sight and you don’t need some indication to show the direction. Everything in your sight faces you but you can only focus on a specific tiny part.</p>
<h2 id="More-examples-of-their-mutual-corroboration-and-correlation"><a href="#More-examples-of-their-mutual-corroboration-and-correlation" class="headerlink" title="More examples of their mutual corroboration and correlation"></a>More examples of their mutual corroboration and correlation</h2><p>There are still some common groups of verbs that illustrate the difference between transitive and intransitive, such as “reach” and “arrive”. Let me post their core definitions to scrutinize them.<br>Arrive (no object): “reach a place at the end of a journey or a stage in a journey”<br>Reach (with object): “arrive at; get as far as”<br>Another meaning of Reach (no object, with adverbial of direction): “stretch out an arm in a specified direction in order to touch or grasp something”<br>Based on the regulation in Japanese, I found that the gist is that whether the “carrier of action” exists or not determines the property of the word. The most basic definition of “reach (no object)” is specified by its means. At first, it entails arms as the tool and uses many prepositions to describe the movement to get and then attain something. I assume then it started to embody the arrival and omit the prepositions because it’s a linear and direct concept when it refers to getting to someplace like the casting of sight I’ve put forward. Then its appearance changed due to the definition “directly refer to the object or not”, but its connotation is still uniform. I think there is also an evolution according to its logic for “arrive”. The meaning of its elements is “get to the shore” then it has been used to describe reaching somewhere but at the beginning, its range is precise and requires the preposition to point out the destination. As for the definitions of “see” and “look”, you “see” with your eyes as a tool and you “look at” something. “Look” indicates your “direct your gaze” and “at” indicates the destination. The former is operated by the tool “eyes” and the latter is operated by directing your action “gaze” and pinpointing the object by “preposition”, which is not propelled by some tool logically. As a result, it’s a robust demonstration of the argument for the title, about the connection between the initiative of the action itself and your vision.</p>
<h1 id="The-analogy-of-vision-related-words"><a href="#The-analogy-of-vision-related-words" class="headerlink" title="The analogy of vision-related words"></a>The analogy of vision-related words</h1><p>So far, we can resolve the categories of all verbs associated with your vision. If I cast my eyes actively, I “look at” “gaze at” and “glance at”. If I receive messages from my view, I “see” “perceive” and “glimpse” (derived from the word “glimmer”). As for the prepositions, just from my perspective, “at” implies the destination of an action, and “to” implies the route. So it’s easy to understand why there is a difference between “shout at” and “shout to”.</p>
<h1 id="Some-supplementary-explanations"><a href="#Some-supplementary-explanations" class="headerlink" title="Some supplementary explanations"></a>Some supplementary explanations</h1><p>You might notice that there’s a subordinate entry for “see” that shows that it can also serve as an intransitive verb to specify the route of the movement. The distinction between intransitive and transitive verbs is whether the verb connects itself to the object by a precise and limited guide in direction or not. For example, the one I referred to in my essay is “reach”, “reach” is transitive when it indicates broad arrival. But when it denotes the movement of the hand, we need to pinpoint a specific range within a tiny part. So it’s indeed a conditional supplement for both “reach” and “see” here because they have a meaning of passive broad reception that provides the broad scope for using a preposition to pinpoint actively. — As for an essentially intransitive verb, a preposition is a necessary indicator of a specific direction due to the verb’s property of only being able to perform an action instead of leading it to an end. Its initiative determines its limited range, because our attention is also limited.<br>I know some about Romance languages based on my Spanish about B1 level and some French, and as a self-proclaimed linguist, I learned a little about Germanic languages about their structure and properties (but I don’t know German or Dutch except some of their cognates in English). I discovered that when it comes to the use of intransitive verbs, West Germanic languages like English, German, and Dutch tend to use some specific prepositions to point out the state of movement. The Germanic languages also have a feature that the verb always alters its vowel when conjugating to change its tense or part of speech. And as for Romance languages like Spanish and French, they don’t distinguish them. Sometimes, the word “a” in Spanish (like “to”, indicating belonging or transition giving me the sense of being on route) serves as a similar role but with a different logic. When my Spanish improves, I’ll try to explain it.</p>
<h1 id="Finally…-The-end"><a href="#Finally…-The-end" class="headerlink" title="Finally… The end!"></a>Finally… The end!</h1><p>As a self-proclaimed linguist, my theory is based on my personal observations and reasoning, and it may not apply to all languages or situations. There may be other factors or dimensions that influence the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs, such as aspect, modality, voice, or valency. There may also be different ways of interpreting or explaining the data that I have presented. For example, one could argue that the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs is not related to the initiative of action and vision, but rather to the semantic roles or thematic relations of the arguments, such as agent, patient, theme, goal, source, etc. These are some of the possible challenges or criticisms that my theory may face, and I welcome further discussion and feedback from other linguists or language learners.<br>I hope this essay will help expand your cognition.
