    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="Deng-Gong-and-pragmatism"><a href="#Deng-Gong-and-pragmatism" class="headerlink" title="Deng Gong and pragmatism"></a>Deng Gong and pragmatism</h1><p>Personally, I believe that the core of Deng’s thinking is pragmatism, is “crossing the river by feeling the stones” spirit of exploration, not bound to any so-called factions, after all, the factions are mortal set out, but science has repeatedly proved that any generalized words are inaccurate, can not be generalized, and even my so-called pragmatism is only a small part of their political thinking, just all I see, can not be generalized, the practice of after-the-fact conclusion, there is the suspicion of “horse hindsight”. Even my so-called pragmatism is only a very small part of their political thinking, just all I see, can not be generalized, the practice of hindsight, there is the suspicion of “horse hindsight”, but I should still speak out, so that there is a friction of ideas, and there is continuous progress.</p>
<h1 id="It’s-not-what-it-used-to-be-the-trade-off-between-conservatism-and-openness"><a href="#It’s-not-what-it-used-to-be-the-trade-off-between-conservatism-and-openness" class="headerlink" title="It’s not what it used to be, the trade-off between conservatism and openness"></a>It’s not what it used to be, the trade-off between conservatism and openness</h1><p>In my humble opinion, as of now, the present president is the best. He is neither a reformist nor a Maoist. Rather, he has drawn on the essence of both sides and, to summarize inaccurately, is a pragmatist. On the one hand, the strengthening of ideological education in the areas of national unity and national solidarity has had a very good effect, instilling correct thinking in some of the grassroots people who are lack for judge ability, and preventing those who have the intention of splitting the country , which is what the so-called Maoists do. On the other hand, we have adopted a compromise approach in all our policies,which are eclectic in approach, not radicalized, and retaining the open part of our policies, which is the approach of the “reformists”.</p>
<h2 id="Conservative-the-cornerstone-of-unity"><a href="#Conservative-the-cornerstone-of-unity" class="headerlink" title="Conservative, the cornerstone of unity"></a>Conservative, the cornerstone of unity</h2><p>First, let me explain the former. Human beings have a very strong ability to learn from each other, but whenever we are not closed to the outside world as in the late Qing Dynasty, we are constantly learning from the outside world. Today, there are only a few countries in the world that are socialist, and there are only a few successful socialist countries in history, and most of them didn’t end well, which gives many people the illusion that universal suffrage is the ultimate solution to the problems of today’s society. The truth is that universal suffrage is likely to be a disaster for us, just like Gorbachev’s democratic reforms, which directly divided the world’s largest country and plunged several Soviet Union member states into chaos. Reforms must be past correcting, and it is difficult to achieve without vigorous reforms, but vigorous reforms that move the roots are only the beginning of chaos, are self-destructive, and undermine the momentum of China’s forward movement today, or even once again fall into decades of stagnation. Decentralization is not an option. Internal and external problems can only destroy a country completely, and this is one of the few lessons we can learn from history.</p>
<h2 id="Open-the-gateway-to-progress"><a href="#Open-the-gateway-to-progress" class="headerlink" title="Open, the gateway to progress"></a>Open, the gateway to progress</h2><p>As for the latter, it’s easy to see how such a momentum, for example, months ago issued a notice of app filing, website filing has also been a long time. I have not long ago experienced what the record is like, its role is not to limit the individual, but to limit the enterprise and collective profit-making and limit the resolution of domain names, after all, most people are not too much discernment, and even the so-called highly educated college students are often cheated, here will not be expanded in detail. We do not add restrictions on the server itself, my U.S. &amp; Hong Kong servers can be directly connected. Only to buy a large offshore server, can you indirectly access to foreign networks,and a simple wget command to get what you want like a lot of foreign resources. Restrictions on vpn and other software is just to raise the fence on ordinary people, rather than sealing off the channel of national knowledge exchange, according to Hunan University students said, the school will have a special line for academic exchanges. Similar examples will not be listed, what we have practiced is a compromise and moderate method to keep China’s openness and continuous academic development.</p>
<h1 id="Today’s-greatest-threat-division"><a href="#Today’s-greatest-threat-division" class="headerlink" title="Today’s greatest threat - division"></a>Today’s greatest threat - division</h1><p>I think the biggest concern today is the spread of divisive ideas. We collectively have fewer and fewer common memories, people have fewer and fewer common topics, and class conflicts and antagonisms have emerged. We have to enhanced sensitization and awareness-raising, because cultural innovations are usually related to the pain of life, and art comes from pain, and pain comes from life, and art is a different kind of catharsis. Promoting negative content only exacerbates divisions. As long as we use the Internet and foreigners come to communicate with us, there will be a fusion of ideas and even “westernization”, which is a normal phenomenon, and we only need to control the divisive ideas and it will not be a problem. Therefore, “one country, two systems” cannot be used as a long term strategy but just a stopgap measure. Otherwise, Hong Kong will be the first step towards secession, and it is difficult to say which other regions will follow. Splitting up will inevitably lead to chaos, to turmoil, to stagnation of development and even to the stoppage of the political machinery. The ruling basis of a country is the leadership of the Communist Party, then it cannot be changed at will. The state machinery runs and develops like a vehicle running on the highway, it cannot change its engine halfway. We are such a huge country, the cost of replacing the “engine” is too great, our feudal Confucian political machine has been running for thousands of years, a “shutdown maintenance” is a few hundred years of major upheavals, in our good peace is not long and then again will only be more than worth the loss!  It is clear that the biggest threat to China’s steady progress is the independence of certain area. Today’s continuous propaganda is gradually weakening, and it is important to start with the children, continue to strengthen patriotic education, and oppose any form of secession. These children will grow up to be an important force against secession, fighting and balancing against those who have been “westernized”, while the rulers must not be swayed by either force and continue to maximize their power.</p>
<h1 id="Leaders-for-the-people"><a href="#Leaders-for-the-people" class="headerlink" title="Leaders for the people"></a>Leaders for the people</h1><p>If I may say so, the supreme leader is the one who truly serves the people. If you succeed, your name will go down in history, but you will offend a lot of people and it will be difficult for you to end up in a good way; if you fail, no one will pay attention to you, and you will even be cursed for the rest of your life. The reason why the United States do not have to worry, because the decentralization of power, making the separation of responsibilities, generalized into the collective decision-making of the government. Your scold the federal government, has nothing to do with the individual. And numerous experiments have shown that in a sufficiently complex collective, troublemakers, hard workers, chaos and constantly joining and exiting a variety of candidates, representing the interests of all the forces of the complex collective joint decision-making, often offset the negative effects, to make rational collective decision-making, can lead to the maximization of benefits. To the individual, you make the decision that best meets your interests, other parties also do what best meets their interests, the struggle within the group, the benefit of the collective. The Chinese leadership, is a person’s true selflessness, relying on personal commitment and personal noble character.</p>
<h2 id="Our-heritage"><a href="#Our-heritage" class="headerlink" title="Our heritage"></a>Our heritage</h2><p>Here’s an interesting question, and one that centers on the cultural gap between China and the western world: If a member of your family were seriously ill and had a short time to live, would you tell him? The Chinese traditionally keep it a secret from the whole family, because by telling him, you are removing your guilt and it is the easiest way for you. And keep a secret, the Chinese believe that this is a kind of responsibility, guilt by themselves to bear, rather than let the patient suffer, this is the living can be for the dying person’s greatest understanding, although the results of such a choice may not be good, and I do not do not judge which is better, but this is the difference between thinking and culture.<br>Similarly, China’s top leaders work hard when they come to power, out of a similar motivation, because they feel that you are responsible for the fate of all Chinese people, and you need to work hard not to be guilty about what you’ve done confront the trust of all people, and confront the “ancestors”. According to Western theories, there can be no divinity in human beings, but the Chinese culture is deeply engraved in our bones, so that we have such selfless qualities, this kind of quality for the sake of the collective, so that we have continued for thousands of years, not to be slaughtered by other ethnicities, because we have always been a big collective. If we are not capable enough to take on such a great responsibility, we will elect the next leader and let our next leader continue to work hard; if we are able to do so, we will take control of the whole country and then give our best.</p>
<h1 id="Reflections-on-opponents"><a href="#Reflections-on-opponents" class="headerlink" title="Reflections on opponents"></a>Reflections on opponents</h1><p>For some people to attack China’s political system, I will think of two situations, one, is it fishing to profit from it, yes, I have nothing to say, but it is no different from those who make a fortune from national tragedy, and shorting the destiny of the whole of China, and two, whether he or she does not understand the thinking of the Chinese people and our present strategy, this is a very common situation. Perhaps because the authorities are so obsessed, there are really not many people I have seen who can maintain their personal judgment in the midst of political propaganda and the compulsions of foreign powers.<br>Some people attack the extreme patriots, but I say there is no need to do so, as they have their own social role to play. Many of them are young people whose thinking is not yet in shape, and they may gradually come to their senses in the future. Their role today is to distract the attention of the other part of the population, to fight against the westernizers and to prevent the spread of separatist ideas.<br>Extreme patriotic sentiments, stupid because they deify the Communist Party, just as the Chinese have believed in Taoism for 2,000 years, is one of the legacies of our history, deifying what we do not understand. Deification of science, deification of the individual, are all signs of backwards thinking, just one of the inevitable products of history, don’t worry about it.</p>
