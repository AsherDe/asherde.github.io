<h1 id="Transitive-and-Intransitive-You-perceive-your-whole-view-passively-and-focus-on-a-pinpoint-actively"><a href="#Transitive-and-Intransitive-You-perceive-your-whole-view-passively-and-focus-on-a-pinpoint-actively" class="headerlink" title="Transitive and Intransitive: You perceive your whole view passively and focus on a pinpoint actively"></a>Transitive and Intransitive: You perceive your whole view passively and focus on a pinpoint actively</h1><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>I believe that many non-English speakers or people who don’t speak Germanic languages (I’ll explain my discovery through sorting at the end) have been plagued by the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs for a long time in terms of the use of prepositions. We see there are two kinds of marks ahead of the dictionary entries presented as “with object” and “no object” respectively, which correspond to them. But how can we sort them based on their properties?<br>In this essay, I will explore the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs in English, Japanese (it’s also Chinese indeed because of the complete use of Chinese characters here). Transitive verbs are verbs that can take a direct object, while intransitive verbs are verbs that cannot. This distinction has implications for the use of prepositions, the role of the subject, and the expression of agency and initiative. I will compare and contrast how these languages handle this distinction and what it reveals about their grammatical and semantic features.</p>
<h2 id="The-connection-between-one’s-initiative-and-the-spectrum-of-the-action-itself"><a href="#The-connection-between-one’s-initiative-and-the-spectrum-of-the-action-itself" class="headerlink" title="The connection between one’s initiative and the spectrum of the action itself"></a>The connection between one’s initiative and the spectrum of the action itself</h2><h3 id="The-cases-in-Japanese"><a href="#The-cases-in-Japanese" class="headerlink" title="The cases in Japanese"></a>The cases in Japanese</h3><p>I will examine them first in Japanese, which has a clear and consistent way of marking transitive and intransitive verbs. In Japanese, transitive verbs are called 他動詞 (tadoushi), which literally means “other-moving verb” or “other-propulsive verb”, while intransitive verbs are called 自動詞 (jidoushi), which literally means “self-moving verb” or “self-propulsive verb”. These terms indicate whether the verb expresses an action that affects another entity or not. For example, ドアが開いた (doa ga aita) means “The door opened”, where the door is both the subject and the agent of the action, while ドアを開けた (doa o aketa) means “I opened the door”, where the door is the object and I am the agent of the action. The difference is marked by the use of different verb forms (開いた vs 開けた) and different particles (が vs を).<br>It’s clear and easy to reason that the role of the subject is decisive. And if the object which is acted upon is absent in form, something that is acted upon is also the thing that acts.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the meanings and definitions of transitive and intransitive.<br>The meaning of transitive: “be able to go across”<br>The definition of transitive: “able to take a direct object (expressed or implied)”<br>Vice versa for the intransitive.<br>And I wondered about the connection between them and their intertwined inner logic.</p>
<h3 id="Back-to-each-part-of-English"><a href="#Back-to-each-part-of-English" class="headerlink" title="Back to each part of English"></a>Back to each part of English</h3><p>But Japanese is not English, they are not even relatives in any degree. Then I took apart each word in some easy sentences.<br>“I saw him.” “I looked at him.”<br>Then I discovered that I needed a preposition to indicate the state of the action when I used the intransitive, but why didn’t I need one for a transitive verb? Then I looked up the definitions of these two words from a dictionary and here are their most basic definitions. See (with object): “perceive with the eyes; discern visually” Look (no object): “direct one’s gaze toward someone or something or in a specified direction” and “have the appearance or give the impression of being” I read these sentences totally and each word separately to connect them to my cognition. It’s easy to tell the difference between them. “I saw him” means I “perceived him with my eyes”, which is passive reception. “I looked at him” means I “directed my gaze” to him, which is active participation.<br>The last question was why the preposition is necessary only for an intransitive verb. Then I raised my head, perceived everything in my view and gazed at some things. And I finally understood through incorporating the initiative of actions in Japanese and the vision of humans in English. When I cast my eyes there’s only a beam emitted and I need to use a preposition to pinpoint my object, so this kind of word is “intransitive”, it’s not able to go across the object so we need a preposition to specify. But why doesn’t the transitive verb need one? Because you can perceive everything within your sight so you don’t need some indication to show the direction. Everything in your sight you but you can only focus on a specific tiny part.</p>
<h3 id="More-examples-of-their-mutual-corroboration-and-correlation"><a href="#More-examples-of-their-mutual-corroboration-and-correlation" class="headerlink" title="More examples of their mutual corroboration and correlation"></a>More examples of their mutual corroboration and correlation</h3><p>There are still some common groups of verbs that illustrate the difference between transitive and intransitive, such as “reach” and “arrive”. Let me post their core definitions in order to scrutinize them. Arrive (no object): “reach a place at the end of a journey or a stage in a journey” Reach (with object): “arrive at; get as far as” And another meaning of Reach (no object, with adverbial of direction): “stretch out an arm in a specified direction in order to touch or grasp something” Based on the regulation in Japanese, I found that the gist is that whether the “carrier of action” exists or not determines the property of the word. The most basic definition of “reach (no object)” is specified by its means. At first, it entails arms as the tool and uses many prepositions to describe the movement to get then attain something. I assume then it started to embody the arrival and omit the prepositions because it’s a linear and direct concept when it refers to getting to some place like the casting of sight I’ve put forward. And then its appearance changed due to the definition “directly refer to the object or not”, but its connotation is still uniform. I think there is also an evolution according to its logic for “arrive”. The meaning of its elements is “get to the shore” then it has been used to describe reaching somewhere but at the beginning its range is precise and requires the preposition to point out the destination. As for the definitions of “see” and “look”, you “see” with your eyes as a tool and you “look at” something. “Look” indicates your “direct your gaze” and “at” indicates the destination. The former is operated by the tool “eyes” and the latter is operated by directing your action “gaze” and pinpointing the object by “preposition”, which is not propelled by some tool logically. As a result, it’s a robust demonstration of the argument for the title. The connection between the initiative of the action itself and your vision.</p>
<h2 id="The-analogy-of-vision-related-words"><a href="#The-analogy-of-vision-related-words" class="headerlink" title="The analogy of vision-related words"></a>The analogy of vision-related words</h2><p>So far, we can resolve the categories of all verbs associated with your vision. If I cast my eyes actively, I “look at” “gaze at” “glance at” If I receive messages from my view, I “see” “perceive” “I glimpse” (derived from the word “glimmer”) As for the prepositions, just from my perspective, “at” implies the destination of an action and “to” implies the route. So it’s easy to understand why there is a difference between “shout at” and “shout to”.</p>
<h2 id="Some-supplementary-explanations"><a href="#Some-supplementary-explanations" class="headerlink" title="Some supplementary explanations"></a>Some supplementary explanations</h2><p>I know some about Romance languages based on my Spanish about B1 level and some French, and as a self-proclaimed linguist, I learned a little about Germanic languages about their structure and properties (but I don’t know German or Dutch except some of their cognates in English). I discovered that when it comes to the use of intransitive verbs, West Germanic languages like English, German, and Dutch tend to use some specific prepositions to point out the state of movement. The Germanic languages also have a feature that the verb always alters its vowel when conjugating to change its tense or part of speech. And as for Romance languages like Spanish and French, they don’t distinguish them. Sometimes, the word “a” in Spanish (like “to”, indicating belonging or transition giving me the sense of being on route) serves as a similar function but with a different logic. When my Spanish improves, I’ll try to explain it.</p>
<h2 id="Finally…-The-end"><a href="#Finally…-The-end" class="headerlink" title="Finally… The end!"></a>Finally… The end!</h2><p>As a self-proclaimed linguist, my theory is based on my personal observations and reasoning, and it may not apply to all languages or situations. There may be other factors or dimensions that influence the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs, such as aspect, modality, voice, or valency. There may also be different ways of interpreting or explaining the data that I have presented. For example, one could argue that the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs is not related to the initiative of action and vision, but rather to the semantic roles or thematic relations of the arguments, such as agent, patient, theme, goal, source, etc. These are some of the possible challenges or criticisms that my theory may face, and I welcome further discussion and feedback from other linguists or language learners.<br>I hope this revision will help you improve your linguistic essay and make it more clear, coherent, and convincing. If you have any questions or need more help, please let me know.</p>

          <h1 id="提升专业技能"><a href="#提升专业技能" class="headerlink" title="提升专业技能"></a>提升专业技能</h1><p>未来是AI的时代，然而我认为AI并不是一场革命，更不会完全取代人类的工作，反之他象征着人类将从重复的工作中得到解放，象征着人类生产力的进一步提升。<br>当我使用ChatGPT阅读一篇长文，它可以轻松分析出文章的逻辑结构，可以借助文章本身以及其他资料解释你提出的任何问题，但是我并不觉得他会具备一位合格教师所应该有的除了答疑和读PPT以外的其他专业技能。<br>当我使用copilot编写代码时，ai可以通过你的只言片语推断出你想要表达的逻辑结构，一瞬间智能补全几十行代码，因为这些代码都是之前有人写过的，我们学习的是前人的思考成果，AI所做不到的是我们创造的能力，这也进一步要求我们需要有更进一步的专业能力，而非简单的重复。</p>
<h1 id="提高人文素养"><a href="#提高人文素养" class="headerlink" title="提高人文素养"></a>提高人文素养</h1><p>语言是文化的大门，一方面要了解中国的历史文化，了解文学作品，历史发展，不能被功利主义所裹挟而沦为工具人，同时也有助于我们培养自己的判断力。另一方面语言是文化的大门，通过学习和使用外语能让我们看到地球另一端的世界，以他人为镜，可以完善自己，以语言为桥，可以跨过不同文化的鸿沟。各国互相难分难舍，我们的国家将会需要大量既有扎实的专业知识又有丰富的人文知识储备的人才。这也是为什么英语是我们从小需要学习的主科。当有国际视野，成为综合水平强、真正国际化的人才。</p>
<h1 id="心系天下"><a href="#心系天下" class="headerlink" title="心系天下"></a>心系天下</h1><p>科技的飞速发展很大程度离不开自然环境，Google，Microsoft，Amazon等公司公布了2022年的用水数据，仅微软一个月就使用了4353万升水，这些水尽管最终会回到地面，但是仍然需要很长的时间，直接造成美国爱荷华州饮用水匮乏。而且大量用水会造成一系列连锁反应，对自然产生不可预测的影响。其中很大的原因就是训练AI需要使用大量的水，平均问ChatGPT五到五十个问题就会消耗500ml水。类似的事情一直都在发生，可能对我们这一代人影响不大。着眼长远，这是全人类的问题，就如墨西哥科学家主导解决臭氧层空洞，各国领导人签署《蒙特利尔议定书》一样，地球的问题也是全人类的问题，值得每一个人关注。环境问题未来会是我们无可避免的责任。</p>
<h1 id="结语"><a href="#结语" class="headerlink" title="结语"></a>结语</h1><p>我们作为新时代的青年，应该积极关注社会发展，承担全社会乃至全人类的责任，让自己成为有用之人。</p>

<h3 id="生而渺小"><a href="#生而渺小" class="headerlink" title="生而渺小"></a>生而渺小</h3><p>人之于更广的世界，不过蝼蚁。生之即来，死而无踪。空虚追逐在每个人的身后，    自己不寻求价值的实现就只剩空虚的生活。<br>生活赐予你的，随时都可以拿走，你的一切只是它微不足道的一部分。<br>真正的幸运莫过于我在此，还能用我一点力量敲击键盘，留下文字，记录我的思想，借此创造一点可笑的存在感。</p>
<p>记忆中的真正快意是在他人面前展现自己擅长的一面，获得赞赏与旁人的羡慕，人所能感知的无非这一点存在感，创造我们骄傲自豪的一面。</p>
<p><strong>就像有什么宏大的东西控制着我们，一切都变成一个点化作数据，被决定他们怎么调配这些单元，或者说只有几个特定的数据类型被量化</strong>，一切都被你的思想所掌控，你所做之事都是你的大脑所逻辑自洽的事情，我们是生活的奴隶，是自己的奴隶。</p>
<h3 id="死而平等"><a href="#死而平等" class="headerlink" title="死而平等"></a>死而平等</h3><p>Google的创始人收购医疗公司，研究长生不死的秘诀，长生不死即无限放大了我们自己，若能永生，人非人，而成为了人幻想中的神，与时间同在，才能真正控制生活，而非在终焉时任他摆布。从古而今，达官贵族，帝王将相都想长生不老，似乎也能理解。<strong>死亡是人类最后的公平</strong>。正因顺其自然，人的思想才在迭代，亘古不变的东西应当让他埋到土里。毕竟small as we are，我们要相信长江后浪推前浪。</p>
